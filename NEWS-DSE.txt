MAXIMUM TTL EXPIRATION DATE NOTICE
-----------------------------------

The maximum expiration timestamp that can be represented by the storage engine is 2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00,
which means that inserts with TTL that expire after this date are not currently supported.

Prior to 5.0.12 in the 5.0.X series and 5.1.7 in the 5.1.X series, there was no protection against INSERTS
with TTL expiring after the maximum supported date, causing the expiration time field to overflow and the
records to expire immediately. Expired records due to overflow may have been removed permanently after a
compaction. The 4.8.X series are not subject to data loss due to this issue if assertions are enabled,
since an AssertionError is thrown during INSERT when the expiration time field overflows on these versions.

In practice this issue will affect only users that use very large TTLs, close to the maximum allowed value of
630720000 seconds (20 years), starting from 2018-01-19T03:14:06+00:00. As time progresses, the maximum supported
TTL will be gradually reduced as the the maximum expiration date approaches. For instance, a user on an affected
version on 2028-01-19T03:14:06 with a TTL of 10 years will be affected by this bug, so we urge users of very
large TTLs to upgrade to a version where this issue is addressed as soon as possible.

Potentially affected users should inspect their SSTables and search for negative min local deletion times to
detect this issue. SSTables in this state must be backed up immediately, as they are subject to data loss
during auto-compactions, and may be recovered by running the sstablescrub tool from versions 5.0.12+ and/or 5.1.7+.

We plan to fix this limitation in newer versions, but while the fix is not available, operators
can decide which policy to apply when dealing with inserts with TTL exceeding the maximum supported expiration date:
  - REJECT: this is the default policy and will reject any requests with expiration date timestamp after 2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00.
  - CAP: any insert with TTL expiring after 2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00 will expire on 2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00 and the client will receive a warning.
  - CAP_NOWARN: same as previous, except that the client warning will not be emitted.

These policies may be specified via the -Dcassandra.expiration_date_overflow_policy=POLICY startup option which can be set in the
jvm.options file.

See CASSANDRA-14092 for more details.

DSE 6.0
=======

New features
------------
   - Core storage engine functions have been moved to a new Thread Per Core (TPC) architecture, enabling many
     performance gains. Several yaml settings have been removed as a result. See the deprecation section for more
     information. The file cache default size has been increased to facilitate async disk reads as a result. TPC also
     requires several new system configurations for optimal performance. The meaning of threadpool metrics has changed,
     and are now reported per core if the "--core" option is provided to tpstats. See the upgrading and metrics sections
     for more information.
   - An integrated continuous background repair service called NodeSync has been added. NodeSync can be enabled as a
     service on individual nodes. NodeSync is disabled on tables by default. NodeSync can be enabled on a table with a
     configurable deadline deadline_target_sec by altering the NodeSync options on an existing table or providing
     NodeSync options when creating a table. Traditional anti-entropy repairs will be rejected on tables with NodeSync
     enabled. NodeSync's target repair rate can be set through the rate_in_kb parameter in the NodeSync section of
     cassandra.yaml. A new command line tool for cluster-wide management of NodeSync called "nodesync" has been added.
     It can be used to enable/disable NodeSync on tables, configure NodeSync, manage one-off user validations, or trace
     NodeSync operation. See "nodesync help" for more information. The NodeSync service on an
     individual node can be managed through "nodetool nodesyncservice". A simulator accessible through
     "nodetool nodesyncservice ratesimulator" can help configure NodeSync for your workload.
   - Functions may now be used in the GROUP BY clause of CQL queries, provided the function is 1) applied
     to a single clustering column, 2) monotonic on the clustering column argument, 3) applied to the last clustering
     column of the GROUP BY clause, and 4) excepting the function call, the columns appear in primary key order.
     User-defined functions are allowed in the GROUP BY clause if marked monotonic. See the CQL spec for how to mark a
     user-defined function monotonic on one or all arguments. User-defined functions in the GROUP BY clause also
     require setting enable_user_defined_functions_threads to false in cassandra.yaml, with the security risks described
     in the yaml file.
   - SSTables now use trie-based indices for both partitions and rows. These indices are stored on disk as new sstable
     components *-Partitions.db and *-Rows.db. Old format sstables will continue to use the key cache and legacy indexes
     until upgraded. Any custom types implemented by extending AbstractType will need to implement
     asByteComparableSource for compatibility with trie-based indices.
   - Multiple privileges can be granted to or revoked from a role in one CQL statement. The syntax of the GRANT and
     REVOKE statements has been extended to accept a comma-separated list of privileges rather than a single privilege.
   - DSE protocol v2 now allows sending the keyspace of a query independent of the query string. See the DSE protocol v2
     specification for more information.
   - DSE protocol v2 includes client-side backpressure for continuous paging queries. See the DSE protocol v2 spec for
     more information.
   - The ability to RESTRICT and UNRESTRICT privileges has been added to CQL. RESTRICTed privileges always take
     precedence over granted privileges. Only superusers may use RESTRICT and UNRESTRICT.
   - CQL now allows GRANTing the ability to AUTHORIZE privileges. This enables separation of duties by allowing roles
     to grant specific privileges to other roles.
   - Access to schema tables can be limited by setting system_keyspaces_filtering to true in cassnadra.yaml. With this
     option enabled, non-superusers cannot read the system/system_schema keyspaces without being granted the DESCRIBE
     permission on those keyspaces.

Operations
----------
   - A new metric is exposed to track timeouts on view lock acquisition when updating materialized views. This
     metric can be accessed at org.apache.cassandra.metrics.Table.ViewLockAcquisitionTimeouts.<Keyspace>.<Table>.
   - Rebuild functionality now requires to specify the streaming source endpoints and/or DC/racks
     and no longer implicitly prefers the local data center. Specifying no sources or DC/racks is
     now considered an error. See `nodetool help rebuild` about which combinations of DCs/racks or endpoints to include
     or exclude are possible.
   - Added batchlog_endpoint_strategy option and 2 new strategies to cassandra.yaml. The default is
     "random_remote", which works as in previous versions. Two new strategies help to choose better
     endpoints and improve batchlog write latency. See cassandra.yaml for details.
   - Nodetool repair will now run full repairs by default, use "-inc" option to run incremental repair.
   - Incremental repairs are disallowed on tables with Materialized Views or CDC. Run full repairs on these
     tables.
   - A new BACKGROUND_IO stage was created to handle blocking background IO operations like cache loading,
     commit log segment allocation and replay. The maximum size of this thread pool is governed by the system
     property cassandra.io.background.max_pool_size.
   - TimeWindowCompactionStrategy can now split sstables on flush to better align with TWCS windows. This behavior
     can be configured by setting the "split_during_flush" parameter in TWCS options for a table. "split_during_flush"
     defaults to false.
   - The contents of the DroppedMessage map have been changed to better reflect the type of operations
     being tracked. The tracked messages now include COUNTER_MUTATION, MUTATION, VIEW_MUTATION,
     RANGE_SLICE, READ, READ_REPAIR, LWT, HINTS, TRUNCATE, SNAPSHOT, SCHEMA, REPAIR, and OTHER.
   - Because TPC fundamentally changes the architecture of internal processing, the output of metrics related to
     task execution or thread pool statistics has changed significantly. In particular, tpstats and statuslogger
     output will be affected, as TPC task types are now reported rather than threadpool statistics. See the
     documentation for more information on how to interpret these metrics. To see metrics per core, provide the
     "--cores" option to tpstats.

Upgrading
---------
   - The ITrigger interface has been modified from "augment" to "augmentNonBlocking" for non-blocking
     internal architecture. Updated trigger implementations will need to be provided on upgraded nodes.
   - Removed support for directly setting JMX remote port via the com.sun.management.jmxremote.port
     system property, deprecated since 3.6.
   - The table system_auth.resource_role_permissons_index is no longer used and should be dropped
     after all nodes are on 6.0.
   - Changes to permissions (CassandraAuthorizer, DseAuthorizer), roles (CassandraRoleManager,
     DseRoleManager) and credentials (PasswordAuthenticator) are broadcasted throughout the cluster.
     This eliminates the need to have short-ish validity (permissions_validity_in_ms,
     roles_validity_in_ms, credentials_validity_in_ms) and update-interval
     (permissions_update_interval_in_ms, roles_update_interval_in_ms,
     credentials_update_interval_in_ms) settings in cassandra.yaml. Consider raising the values
     for *_validity_in_ms and *_update_interval_in_ms, if configured.
     Please note, that only "reachable" nodes will receive the invalidation messages and
     unreachable nodes may still hold outdated information after DCL command.
   - GRANT, REVOKE, RESTRICT and UNRESTRICT emit a client-warning when such a statement would not change
     anything. This means, the warning is returned when the statement targets permissions which are
     already present (GRANT, RESTRICT) or not present (REVOKE, UNRESTRICT) for that resource.
   - The caches for JMX permissions and credentials no longer exist and therefore the JMX beans
     for these caches have been removed, too. Also the configuration options for the credentials
     cache need to be removed from the cassandra.yaml file.
   - Removed org.apache.cassandra.metrics.Table.{AntiCompactedBytes|NonAntiCompactedBytes} metrics.
   - Due to the TPC rearchitecture, the following properties have been removed from cassandra.yaml: concurrent_reads,
     concurrent_writes, concurrent_counter_writes, concurrent_materialized_view_writes, streaming_socket_timeout_in_ms.
   - The file cache size default has been increased. See file_cache_size_in_mb in cassandra.yaml for more information.
   - Due to the TPC rearchitecture, several system tunables have become more important. These include the Linux clock
     source, the presence of epoll and libaio, the CPU scaling governor, and DIRECT_IO support on data directories.
     Check the system log after startup to see if suboptimal configurations are present.
   - Since client connections are tied to a TPC thread, single process applications issuing a large
     number of concurrent requests may benefit from increasing the number of connections per host.
   - Automatic fallback of GossipingPropertyFileSnitch to PropertyFileSnitch (cassandra-topology.properties) is
     disabled by default and can be enabled via the -Dcassandra.gpfs.enable_pfs_compatibility_mode=true startup
     flag.

Deprecation
-----------
    - The following properties were renamed and are now deprecated before they are removed in the next major release:
      - rpc_address -> native_transport_address
      - rpc_interface -> native_transport_interface
      - rpc_interface_prefer_ipv6 -> native_transport_interface_prefer_ipv6
      - broadcast_rpc_address -> native_transport_broadcast_address
      - rpc_keepalive -> native_transport_keepalive
